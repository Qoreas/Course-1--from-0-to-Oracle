Write a program to solve this problem.
The surveillance camera automatically registers the speed passing by cars, rounding the speed values to numbers.
It is necessary to determine the presence of the registered speed of the vehicle.
If the speed of at least one car was less than 30 km/h, print "YES", otherwise print "N0".

The program takes as input the number of passing cars N (1 < N < 30), then their speed is output.
The speed value cannot be less than 1 and greater than 300.
