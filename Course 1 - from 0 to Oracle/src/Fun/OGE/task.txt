Write a program that uses sequences to determine the number of numbers that are multiples of 3 and end in 2.
The program receives as input the number of numbers in turn, and then the numbers themselves.
The number of numbers does not exceed 1000.
The modulo numbers entered do not exceed 30,000.
The program must return one number: the number of numbers that are multiples of 3 and end with 2.
